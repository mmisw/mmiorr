The list of individual species that are included in a quantity having a group chemical standard name can vary between models. Where possible- the data variable should be accompanied by a complete description of the species represented- for example- by using a comment attribute. OR Mole concentration means number of moles per unit volume- also called ""molarity""- and is used in the construction mole_concentration_of_X_in_Y- where X is a material constituent of Y. A chemical species denoted by X may be described by a single term such as 'nitrogen' or a phrase such as 'nox_expressed_as_nitrogen'.

sigma_t,A defined or empirically derived standard deviation (sigma_t) for a given time difference (delta_t) for each parameter of interest. ﻿﻿Sigma-t is density of seawater -1000.  ,,QC,,,,"CF does have a ""sea_water_sigma_t""- but CF's definition of ""sea_water_sigma_t"" is Sigma-t of sea water is the density of water at atmospheric pressure (i.e. the surface) having the same temperature and salinity- minus 1000 kg m-3. Note that sea water sigma is not the same quantity as the dimensionless ocean sigma coordinate (see Appendix D of the CF convention)- for which there is another standard name.SEACOOS notes: As for ""sigma_t"" and ""sea_water_sigma_t""-  they do not share the same definition and sigma_t in the DD refers to a statistical variable (used for QC) where as CF refers to a property of water.  A better term for DD would be standard_deviation_with_time.  But please dissociate the two terms in your list.  CeNCOOS notes: The variable name should not be used for sigma (standard deviation of a value)….variance of measurment over some specified period of time. "
delta_t,The difference between the time of last acceptable measurement or value and the time of the measurement or value of interest.,,QC

time_continuity_test,This test evaluates the rate of change of a parameter with time.  The difference between two consecutive measurements or values of a parameter (delta_m) is verified to be less than a maximum allowable change (sigma_t) defined for a specific time period (delta_t). If delta_m is greater than sigma_t then the measurement fails.  If delta_t is greater than maximumTime then the sigma_t evaluated for the maximumTime is used. ,,QC
