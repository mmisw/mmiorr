# Test input for voc2skos
# Empty lines are ignored.
# Lines starting with # are ignored.

# Lines of the form: <identifier> = <value>
# are parsed and interpreted as follows:

# URI for the ontology and namespace for its terms.
# By default, an ad hoc URI is assigned.
ontologyURI = "http://example.org/myont"

# Local name for the concept class:
class = "Foo"

# Properties for the class.
# Well-known properties can be indicated with their typical 
# denotation, eg., skos:preLabel:
skos:prefLabel = "My preferred label for Foo"
skos:definition = "This is a demo skos:definition for concept Foo"

# String defining the hierarchical structure for the terms according to the
# indentation level determined by this string in the first column.
# By default, indentation is ignored.
indent.string = "  "

# The relation to use between the parent and the child when a non-empty 
# indent_string is indicated.
# By default, skos:narrower
indent.property = skos:narrower

# the separator character for the CSV contents below.
# By default, ",".
separator = ","    

# Then, the actual CSV contents defining the terms:

# Header line indicates:
#  - first column: If the column name is "URI", then the values in this column
#    are used exactly as given for the URIs for the terms. Otherwise, the value
#    is used along with the namespase (ontologyURI) to compose the term URI.
#  - subsequent columns indicate the properties to be associated with each term.  
#    Well-known properties, eg., skos:preLabel, can be used, but others can be
#    defined as well.

# Subsequent lines define the terms themselves
